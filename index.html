            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>
              I am an undergraduate of ITM at Illinois Institute of Technology, where one of my studies is mobile-first responsive web design. Most of my pages are just demos, and can be accessed at <a href="http://www.mynes.me/samples">(Currently under construction, but useable.)</a> My first designed web page that goes beyond a demo or personal use is in use by the <a href="http://www.vpc4.nerdcore.co/">Vocalist Producer Challenge IV</a>, an annual Nerdcore music contest for prize money and glory.

              I am the founder and co-host of Nerdy Nonsense: Remixed (previously Nerdy Nonsense before bringing on my friend and fellow student David Sobel as my co-host) on WIIT 88.9FM through my campus radio station.

              I post our show on Mixcloud weekly, which predominantly consists of <a href="http://www.fossyk.in/jmynes/Nerdcore">Nerdcore Hip-Hop</a> and Chiptune/VGM. We even hosted a concert at IIT's The Bog with the bands <a href="https://souporvillainz.bandcamp.com/">Soup or Villainz</a> and <a href="https://1ups.bandcamp.com/">1-UP Creative Mindframe</a>, with free admission. This was co-hosted by my organization bIITcoin Chicago. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nerdy-nonsense-remixed/id1088519600?l=en">We're even on iTunes now!</a>

            <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
            <img src="img/arch.jpg" alt="Arch Linux desktop screenshot" />
            <p>
              I'm a GNU/Linux hobbyist, and have used it as my daily driver since 2012. I enjoy dual or triple booting nearly every device I own, down to my phone, when possible. I got sick of Ubuntu early on and moved on to Crunchbang Debian (which is unfortunately now dead, though forked as <a href="https://crunchbangplusplus.org/">Crunchbang Plus Plus</a>), drawn by its simplicity and low system requirements. When Crunchbang died I moved on to Arch Linux, which I presently use with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/2lol86/openboxconkytint2_some_clever_title_to_make_you/"> these configurations</a> that I found Reddit.

            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <img src="img/rms.jpg" alt="Richard Stallman, FOSS legend" />
            <p>
              One of the primary reasons for my interest in Linux and Bitcoin is my love for the FOSS (Free Open Source Software) community. I'm relatively new to <a href="https://github.com/jmynes">Github submissions</a>, but I'm no stranger to browsing and downloading from other repositories.
